# 2022 Election Candidates Twitter Exploratory Data Analysis

This repo hosts the code that retrived tweets from 2022 presidential election candidates' Twitter archive.

#### Collecting tweets

[cands-twitter-archive.ipynb](./twitter_data_polling.ipynb) This jupyter notebook consists of a sample code that collects such data from a candidate.

(p.s. due to issues with twitter API access, some of the data collected might not be as ideal)

#### Method 


This project will largely follow [this paper](https://github.com/keyonvafa/tbip) for conducting an unsupervised analysis over the tweets' textual content for eliciting potential interpretable results.

Simple EDA analysis will also be carried out in supporting the final analysis.
