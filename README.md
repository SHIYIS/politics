## POLITIX: A Political Text Ideology Extraction Project
More specifically, this is a one dimensional "ideal point" (the author's political stance or ideological standpoint) projector that utilizes Variational Autoencoding methods to quantify an author's political leaning (the author's political position gets projected onto a one dimensional scale that ranges from moderate to progressive).

### Measuring Political Subjectivity with VAE

Drawing inspiration from one of the studies conducted on measuring political subjectivity and quantifying author's political stance through variational inference, this project will largely follow [this paper](https://github.com/keyonvafa/tbip) to conduct an ad hoc analysis and unsupervised modeling over political content in the format of tweets for eliciting potential interpretable results.

A simple EDA ([Exploratory Data Analysis](https://medium.com/@lamsampathkumar0/eda-exploratory-data-analysis-project-using-python-de90cbf4e128)) will also be carried out in supporting the final analysis.
