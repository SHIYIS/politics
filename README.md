## 2022 Presidential Election Candidates' Twitter Archive Exploratory Data Analysis and Text-based Ideal Points Topic Extraction
This repo contains all the code for a quantitatively oriented social science exploratory data analysis (EDA) independent research project

---
### Candidates Twitter Archive
This [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/shiyis/c4pe2022-tweets/blob/main/cands-twitter-archive.ipynb) serves as a sample data collection demo.
(p.s. due to issues with twitter API access, some of the data collected might not be as ideal)

---
### Method
This project will largely follow [this paper](https://github.com/keyonvafa/tbip) for conducting an unsupervised analysis over the tweets' textual content for eliciting potential interpretable results.

Simple EDA analysis will also be carried out in supporting the final analysis.
